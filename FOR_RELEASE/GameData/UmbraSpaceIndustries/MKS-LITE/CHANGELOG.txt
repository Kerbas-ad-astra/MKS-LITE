Compatibility with KSP 1.1
Dependency Updates
With the advent of part search, moved all USI parts back to standard categories
Planetary Storage and Warehouse Distribution now respect disabled warehouses
Warehouses are disabled by default
LightGlobe is now a logistics consumer
Dirt auto-jettison is now based on a positive Periapsis
Added ReplacementParts recipe for EL
Fixed an issue where overflow was not properly transfering into planetary logistics during long catch-up mechanics

0.3.3 - 2016.03.02
------------------
Logistics pulls are now restricted to warehouses
Warehouses can be toggled
3.75m and 5m kontainers and tanks are now distributed warehouses and participate in planetary logistics
Kontainer price fixes (thanks zajc3w!)
Various fixes to EL resources (thanks jd284!)
Added the Crush-O-Matic for converting dirt into fertilizer

0.3.2 - 2016.02.14
-------------------
Fixed the location of several models

0.3.1 - 2016.02.13
------------------
Fixed texture reference in cylindrical tanks (Thanks LouisB3!)
Added a surface attach option for all reactors
Adjusted mass and crash tolerance of all containers for consistency
Increased LqdHydrogen storage to be more in line with stock tank mass ratios
Fixed missing radial tank textures
Added dirt drills, landing wheels, landing stabilizers, the light globe, inflation tank, and skycrane to Kolonization for sharing between MKS-Lite and UKS.
Fixed the ball hub's KIS settings

0.3.0 - 2016.02.08
------------------
Updated the kolonization GUI to show percentages vs. raw numbers
Increased the rate at which efficiency multipliers are gained
Moved USI-LS config file so we can have separate configs for UKS vs MKS-Lite
Consolidated UKS/MKS-Lite TAC-LS and Scrapping configs between MKS-Lite and UKS
Added the mini radial tanks from UKS/MKS-Lite to Core
Added Karborundum, XenonGas, ArgonGas to cylindrical kontainer tanks (thanks LouisB3!)
Moved the original saddle and supply tanks to legacy
Because MKS-Lite lacks a lot of habitat multiplier parts, when using USI-LS, hab is multiplied by 5x (same as USI-LS stand-alone) vs. 1x (for UKS)
Hab wear is disabled by default in MKS-Lite
The agriculture module now takes Mulch and Fertilizer, much like the USI-LS greenhouses and UKS (to keep the experience consistent)
Bumped the Comm-Pack's science bonus to be more in line with the stock MPL (and UKS)
The hab module no longer has a fertilizer converter (this has been moved), but now acts as a nice 75% recycler (so similar to the UKS Pioneer module, since MKS-Lite lacks larger modules to upgrade to).
The smelter no longer converts ore to materialkits (this function has been moved).
The workshop now converts ore into MaterialKits (these are used by both MKS-Lite and EL).
The workshop now acts as an auto-maintenance facility if staffed by an engineer (similar to UKS).  In MKS-Lite this is mostly used for nuclear reactor refueling.

0.2.5 - 2016.02.03
------------------
Reset default life support options to 'grouchiness'

0.2.4 - 2016.02.02
------------------
Kolony Rewards are now exponential and look at the entire vessel's crew
Broke EL config into two configs - parts vs. resources
Increased funds reward for kolonization

0.2.3 - 2016.02.01
------------------
Synced dependency DLLs

0.2.2 - 2016.01.20
------------------
Adjusted TAC-LS Config for MKS-Lite (Feedback appreciated)
Removed extra texture that was causing some issues with the liquid tanks (round, cylinder, and saddle)


0.2.1 - 2016.01.19
------------------
Updated archive to include missing files

0.2.0 - 2016.01.18
------------------
There has been a major cleanup of the logistics logic.  Older mechanics have been consolidated or replaced with Scavanging, Power Distribution, Resource Distribution, and Distributed Warehouses.  See the forum thread for details.
All logistics logic has been moved over to USITools so it can be shared with some of the other non-core mods.
MKS-Lite will not be shown if UKS is installed.
The shared Kolonization DLL and associated configs has been moved to make sharing it easier
When Extraplanetary Launchpads is present, RocketParts are replaced by a combination of SpecializedParts and MaterialKits in the resource chain.
When USI-LS is used, recyclers and habitation rules are in effect.  Supply consumption is also drastically increased.  Penalties for EVA loss and starvation have also been increased.  You can alter these by changing USI-LS.cfg in the Kolonization folder.
Added RemoteTech config to the CommPack (Thanks sirreality!)
Inflatables now set to no crew capacity when deflated.  You cannot deflate a module that contains Kerbals.
Hab modules, Ag modules, and the Scout lander pod act as basic life support recyclers.
Habs can be repaired via the perform maintenance option.  This requires MaterialKits.

0.1.1 - 2015.11.13
------------------
Merged MKS-Lite Resources into CRP

0.1.0 - 2015.11.10
------------------
Updated to KSP 1.0.5
Updated parts to allow distinct part category from core UKS
Thanks NyankoSensei for a negative cost fix on the supply packs!
Bundled CRP
Updated various dependencies
Broke out separate category tabs for MKS-LITe vs UKS

0.0.6 - 2015.10.16
------------------
USI Core updates (containers, reactors, etc.)
Added proper version file

0.0.4 - 2015.10.04
-------------------
Dependency updates
Sci Lab is now a very low efficiency ISRU for fuel

0.0.3 - 2015.10.04
-------------------
Thanks NyankoSensei for an AntennaRange config and some node tweaks to reduce jumpiness
The Scout command pod is now a proper EL survey station
Removed the 3-ton limit for logistics Rovers so that the Scout pod and Karibou can now properly operate as resource distributors
Fixed missing emmissives on the rigid tube and anchor hub
Fixed issue where too muich fertilizer was being consumed - bases should now be able to stockpile organics and (if you have more room in your habs than kerbals) supplies.
Dirt is a lot more common.. common as, well, dirt :P
Ag Module now stores Organics, Fertilizer, and Dirt.
A lot of tweaking on the anchor hub to make it easier to move around
All modules got a diet - most are 1000L, flex o tubes are 500
Hab modules now store Fertilizer
The sifter and smelter now store Ore and Dirt (so less ISMs are needed)

0.0.2 - 2015.10.03
--------------------
Fixed tube and hub colliders for less explosions (May cause issues with existing bases)
Added 'Fertilizer' into the mix and changed the workflow between habs and ag modules slightly.  Habs now recycle into fertilize, and convert organics into supplies/food.  Ag module converts fertilizer plus dirt into organics.
Removed MKS Efficiency equations from MKS-L modules to keep things simple
Reduced KAS/KIS storage volume of all inflatables
Increased storage space in the lander module and added it to the pod
Added missing FlexOTube texture
Corrected errors in the OSE Workshop config

0.0.1 - 2015.10.01
--------------------
Initial Release!
