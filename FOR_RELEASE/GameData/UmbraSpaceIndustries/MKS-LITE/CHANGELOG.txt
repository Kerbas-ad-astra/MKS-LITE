0.2.3 - 2016.02.01
------------------
Synced dependency DLLs

0.2.2 - 2016.01.20
------------------
Adjusted TAC-LS Config for MKS-Lite (Feedback appreciated)
Removed extra texture that was causing some issues with the liquid tanks (round, cylinder, and saddle)


0.2.1 - 2016.01.19
------------------
Updated archive to include missing files

0.2.0 - 2016.01.18
------------------
There has been a major cleanup of the logistics logic.  Older mechanics have been consolidated or replaced with Scavanging, Power Distribution, Resource Distribution, and Distributed Warehouses.  See the forum thread for details.
All logistics logic has been moved over to USITools so it can be shared with some of the other non-core mods.
MKS-Lite will not be shown if UKS is installed.
The shared Kolonization DLL and associated configs has been moved to make sharing it easier
When Extraplanetary Launchpads is present, RocketParts are replaced by a combination of SpecializedParts and MaterialKits in the resource chain.
When USI-LS is used, recyclers and habitation rules are in effect.  Supply consumption is also drastically increased.  Penalties for EVA loss and starvation have also been increased.  You can alter these by changing USI-LS.cfg in the Kolonization folder.
Added RemoteTech config to the CommPack (Thanks sirreality!)
Inflatables now set to no crew capacity when deflated.  You cannot deflate a module that contains Kerbals.
Hab modules, Ag modules, and the Scout lander pod act as basic life support recyclers.
Habs can be repaired via the perform maintenance option.  This requires MaterialKits.

0.1.1 - 2015.11.13
------------------
Merged MKS-Lite Resources into CRP

0.1.0 - 2015.11.10
------------------
Updated to KSP 1.0.5
Updated parts to allow distinct part category from core UKS
Thanks NyankoSensei for a negative cost fix on the supply packs!
Bundled CRP
Updated various dependencies
Broke out separate category tabs for MKS-LITe vs UKS

0.0.6 - 2015.10.16
------------------
USI Core updates (containers, reactors, etc.)
Added proper version file

0.0.4 - 2015.10.04
-------------------
Dependency updates
Sci Lab is now a very low efficiency ISRU for fuel

0.0.3 - 2015.10.04
-------------------
Thanks NyankoSensei for an AntennaRange config and some node tweaks to reduce jumpiness
The Scout command pod is now a proper EL survey station
Removed the 3-ton limit for logistics Rovers so that the Scout pod and Karibou can now properly operate as resource distributors
Fixed missing emmissives on the rigid tube and anchor hub
Fixed issue where too muich fertilizer was being consumed - bases should now be able to stockpile organics and (if you have more room in your habs than kerbals) supplies.
Dirt is a lot more common.. common as, well, dirt :P
Ag Module now stores Organics, Fertilizer, and Dirt.
A lot of tweaking on the anchor hub to make it easier to move around
All modules got a diet - most are 1000L, flex o tubes are 500
Hab modules now store Fertilizer
The sifter and smelter now store Ore and Dirt (so less ISMs are needed)

0.0.2 - 2015.10.03
--------------------
Fixed tube and hub colliders for less explosions (May cause issues with existing bases)
Added 'Fertilizer' into the mix and changed the workflow between habs and ag modules slightly.  Habs now recycle into fertilize, and convert organics into supplies/food.  Ag module converts fertilizer plus dirt into organics.
Removed MKS Efficiency equations from MKS-L modules to keep things simple
Reduced KAS/KIS storage volume of all inflatables
Increased storage space in the lander module and added it to the pod
Added missing FlexOTube texture
Corrected errors in the OSE Workshop config

0.0.1 - 2015.10.01
--------------------
Initial Release!
