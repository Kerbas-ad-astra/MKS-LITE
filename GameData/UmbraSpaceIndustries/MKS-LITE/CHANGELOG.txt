0.0.3 - 2015.10.04
-------------------
Thanks NyankoSensei for an AntennaRange config and some node tweaks to reduce jumpiness
The Scout command pod is now a proper EL survey station
Removed the 3-ton limit for logistics Rovers so that the Scout pod and Karibou can now properly operate as resource distributors
Fixed missing emmissives on the rigid tube and anchor hub
Fixed issue where too muich fertilizer was being consumed - bases should now be able to stockpile organics and (if you have more room in your habs than kerbals) supplies.
Dirt is a lot more common.. common as, well, dirt :P
Ag Module now stores Organics, Fertilizer, and Dirt.
A lot of tweaking on the anchor hub to make it easier to move around
All modules got a diet - most are 1000L, flex o tubes are 500
Hab modules now store Fertilizer
The sifter and smelter now store Ore and Dirt (so less ISMs are needed)

0.0.2 - 2015.10.03
--------------------
Fixed tube and hub colliders for less explosions (May cause issues with existing bases)
Added 'Fertilizer' into the mix and changed the workflow between habs and ag modules slightly.  Habs now recycle into fertilize, and convert organics into supplies/food.  Ag module converts fertilizer plus dirt into organics.
Removed MKS Efficiency equations from MKS-L modules to keep things simple
Reduced KAS/KIS storage volume of all inflatables
Increased storage space in the lander module and added it to the pod
Added missing FlexOTube texture
Corrected errors in the OSE Workshop config

0.0.1 - 2015.10.01
